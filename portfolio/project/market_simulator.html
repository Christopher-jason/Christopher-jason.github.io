								<h2>Exploring Market Dynamics Through a Double Auction Simulation</h2>
								<p>I developed and ran a simulation to understand the dynamics of a double auction market, focusing on the trading behaviors of 20 agents, randomly assigned as buyers or sellers.</p>
							</header>
							<div class="image main"><img src="images/double_auction_simulation.png" alt="Double Auction Simulation" /></div>
							<p>In this study, each buyer and seller placed limit orders with bids and asks generated uniformly at random between 1 and 200. The simulation was designed to explore the interactions within the market, matching trades where bids met or exceeded asks and calculating profits based on a fixed item production cost for sellers.</p>
							<p>The program, crafted in MATLAB, enabled us to simulate 10 rounds of trading per session, over 50 sessions to gather robust data. By doing so, we aimed to capture the variability and potential strategies that could emerge in such a trading environment.</p>
							<p>The results from these sessions showed interesting patterns of trading volumes and profit margins, providing insights into how random bid-ask matching can affect market dynamics. Sellers' profits were particularly revealing, showing both gains and losses, which highlighted the risks inherent in market-based trading.</p>
							<p>This simulation not only serves as a significant educational tool for understanding economic theories but also offers practical insights into the design and behavior of more complex financial markets. The project demonstrates the power of agent-based modeling in financial analysis, and the findings encourage deeper investigations into market mechanisms.</p>
