								<h1>Credit Rating Classification and Investment Grade Prediction</h1>
								<p>Analyzing financial and accounting metrics to predict credit ratings and investment grade status, leveraging machine learning techniques for enhanced accuracy.</p>
							</header>

							<p>This project delves into a dataset comprising 1700 observations of 26 financial and accounting metrics across various industries. Each observation includes a firm's credit rating by Moody's and a designation of investment grade status. The primary objective was to classify each firm into one of 16 Moodyâ€™s credit rating categories and to ascertain the investment grade status, utilizing a dataset divided into an 80% training set and a 20% test set.</p>
							<p>Approaches employed included linear regression with Ridge and Lasso regularization to predict investment grade status, logistic regression for the same purpose, and Neural Networks for categorizing firms into specific rating classes. Each model's parameter selection was meticulously documented, demonstrating the rationale behind each choice and its impact on model performance. This comprehensive analysis not only showcased the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques in financial rating prediction but also illuminated their suitability for different aspects of the problem.</p>
							<p>The results underscore the nuanced capabilities of each approach, providing insights into the complexity of credit rating prediction and the potential of machine learning to navigate this complexity with sophistication and precision.</p>
